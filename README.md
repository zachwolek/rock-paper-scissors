One minor cosmetic issue faced was regarding the font choice and centering during flex-wrap. A free font style found online was chosen to give the Rock Paper Scissor game a retro arcade feel, but however created issues where wrapping text would un-center the display. This issue of adhering to "center" did not persist with fonts that were pre-loaded standard choices. The choice to keep the free font was merely a styling choice, as the personal preference to integrate a unique retro arcade feel outweighed centering display. 

To hide this issue as much as possible, font size was explicitly chosen on "headline" and "banner" displays to be as large as possible without wrappingh, have the centering issues appear on as little instances as possible without sacrificing readability.
